						<h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
						<p>The global aging population is one of the most significant demographic shifts of the 21st century. By 2050, the World Health Organization predicts that one in six people will be over the age of 65 (World Health Organization, 2015). In Canada, the proportion of individuals aged 65 and older is expected to rise from 17% to 25% by 2036 (Government of Canada, 2022).</p>
						<p>As the elderly population grows, healthcare systems will face increasing pressure to meet the rising demand for services such as long-term care, emergency response, and specialized medical treatments. The prevalence of chronic conditions and mobility challenges will further strain resources, necessitating more efficient and accessible healthcare solutions (National Institute on Aging, 2023). Addressing these challenges requires innovative strategies and proactive planning to ensure healthcare systems can effectively meet the evolving needs of an aging population.</p>

					<div class="inner">
						<p>☆ Users can filter and search for locations with high concentrations of elderly populations while also viewing the locations of hospitals, care homes, and ambulance stations.</p>
						<p>☆ Governments can identify regions with high elderly populations, assess areas with inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and allocate resources effectively.</p>
						<p>☆ Elderly individuals and their families can visualize population density and available resources, helping them make informed decisions about relocation or future care needs.</p>
						<p>☆ Healthcare providers can evaluate service gaps in real time, aiding decisions about where to develop new facilities or expand existing services.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Predicting the Future of Aging Populations</h2>
						<p>Populaging leverages machine learning and census data to predict future trends in elderly populations. The predictive model identifies areas expected to experience significant growth in 65+ and 85+ populations, allowing for more effective long-term planning.</p>
						<p>Users can filter predictions by regions with increasing or declining elderly populations or set thresholds to ensure proactive resource allocation.</p>

							<h3>Key Strategies</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Demographic Mapping:</strong> Identify where elderly populations are concentrated today.</li>
								<li><strong>Healthcare Resource Mapping:</strong> Locate hospitals, care homes, and emergency services to pinpoint resource gaps.</li>
								<li><strong>Population Predictions:</strong> Forecast aging trends to enable proactive decision-making.</li>
								<li><strong>Filtering Tools:</strong> Target high-risk zones, track growing elderly populations, and prioritize resource allocation.</li>
								<li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Enable policymakers, healthcare providers, and elderly individuals to make informed decisions for the future.</li>
							</ul>
